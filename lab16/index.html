    <h1>Lab 16: JSON and APIs</h1>
    <p>Work done by: Kyra & Arianna</p>
    <h2>(credit goes to Wess)</h2>

    <h1>Problems</h1>
    <p>One problem we always seem to encounter is getting the JS file to work for us. There is always a bit of a problem whether it is missing a letter, different variable names or things we don't even understand like .done. We had the same trouble in Lab 15 where we didn't know what the APIs required in order to work. When Wess went over it in lecture we kinda understood what was needed in the JS in order for the API to work. So we know that it'll be a problem getting it to work on this Lab.</p>

    <h1>Challenges</h1>
    <p>This was a more time consuming lab since we had to watch a tutorial. One challenge that we liked tho since it's not like the rest of the labs where we are testing our knowledge on new code. We're creating a webiste outside of here. There might be a few things that we may not understand however we are up for it as long as we understand and if it's not executed then our next step would be to ask for help from Wess.</p>

    <h1>Results</h1>
    <p>These are our results! </p>
