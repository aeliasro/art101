    <h1>Lab 15: AJAX</h1>
    <p>Work done by Kyra & Arianna</p>

    <h1>Challenges</h1>
      <p>We think one of the challenges we may encounter will be getting the API to work. It was kind of confusing when we went over it in lecture. (Arianna) wasn't able to understand it fully with her group during lecture and we did not get it to work.</p>

    <h1>Problems</h1>
      <p>Getting the API to an endpoint was the only problem since there were a few APIS given to us by Wess already.</p>

    <h1>Results!</h1>
      <p>Here are our results</p>
