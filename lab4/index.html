		<h1>Challenges</h1>
			<p>As we were working through this lab, it was confusing to understand what the directions were talking about. We did not know what an authors block was or what it did for the code and were confused at why we had to copy the comment list to the html code.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>Some problems we encountered involved adding pictures to the images folder--we did not know what pictures to include why it was relevent to the lab.</p>

		<h3>Results</h3>
			<p>Here are the results!</p>
