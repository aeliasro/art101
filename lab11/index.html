      <h1>Challenges</h1>
      <p>There are times when you have to double check your code because there might be things missing to make it work. There was a challenge when adding the link to our javaScript file where I (Arianna) forgot a piece of code to make the link appear when locally testing.</p>

      <div id="problems" class="sectionbox">
        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>One of our prolems was within our html code where we made some grammatical errors that did not allow the JavaScript link to show up on our browser. We also may have trouble making buttons in our JavaScript, however we will have the lecture slides and W3schools website to help us.</p>
