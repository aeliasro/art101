	<h1>Lab 3 Lab Structures</h1>

	<p>The purpose of this lab was to lock our knowledge for links, images and css files. It was also to help us upload files to our github desktop.</p>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>

	<p>My challenge was creating a file and folder in the Lab 3 folder and getting them to link together. I also learned the hard way that I have to not only thriple check but cuadruple (and I mean check a throusand times) for any mistake I may have ignored. Like the colons and the dashes. A simple mistake can really make you stress out if you can't figure out what it is right away. However, me and my partner figured it out.</p>

	<h3>Results</h3>

	<p>If you are watching this then that means that I made it. If not then I tried and you're only looking at a screenshot of my code.</p>
