    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I am Arianna. I am from Oakland. I took three years of computer science in high shcool, where I learned about java, html and a bit of python. I also took three years of grpahic design. I was determined to make graphic design my major here in college but Santa Cruz did not offer it. So I chose AGPM instead because why not. It's my second year here at UCSC and I look forward to graduating every single day when I wake up at 6 in the morning.</p>
