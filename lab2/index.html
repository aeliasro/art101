		<h1>Hello World</h1>
		<p>Max is a thrid year AGPM major, he is from San Francisco. Max helps me a lot during class. He loves art just as much as I do. He is developing a comic web that he will be finishing and posting in a few months.</p>
		<p>Arianna (me) is also an AGPM major, however I'm a second year. So I know a little less stuff than max does. I have had an internship with Pixar where I got to create a mini movie project and present it to people who work for pixar.</p>
