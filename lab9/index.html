      <h1>Challenges</h1>
      <p>One challenge we think we'll encounter is the get element by id, we went over it only once in lecture and it was super quick. We will be using the lecture slides and W3schools to help us with that.</p>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>We have trouble understanding if this code (element by id) is only used in a Javascript file or if it can be used in a html file as well.</p>

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>Here are our results!</p>

    <p id = "new1El">Happy Halloween</p>
    <p id = "new2El">And Merry Chrysler!</p>
    <p id = "output">Happy Hannukuh?</p>
