  <h1>Challenges</h1>
  <p>For this lab, we had trouble with understanding the variables and labeling tags. To understand these better, we went on W3schools and looked at the lecture slides.</p>

  <h2>Problems</h2>
  <p>We haven't done it yet but I feel like we're going to have trouble understanding the Javascript file and making it work. We did this in class and it was well explained but we think we won't understand it by ourselves...</p>

  <h3>Results</h3>
  <p>Here are our results!</p>
